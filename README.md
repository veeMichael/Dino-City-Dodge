Getting Started

To play the game, you need to run the files in your text editor/IDE while keeping the necessary folders in place. Currently, there are some issues with Pyinstaller, so an executable file is not available.

You will also need to run: 'pip install pygame' if you do not have it installed already.

Gameplay

The objective of the game is to last as long as possible and achieve the highest score. You can increase your speed by colliding with a speed up object, but be careful as this can also lead to unintended collisions with the falling blocks.

Bugs

Please note that there are some minor bugs in the game, such as the blocks or speed up objects sometimes appearing partially or mostly off-screen, but they are still interactable. If the game becomes buggy after a collision, pressing the "R" button should reset everything.
