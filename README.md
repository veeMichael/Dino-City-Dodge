# Dino-City-Dodge (PyGame)

After a couple Pygame attempts I finally got something decent I feel like.
The objective of this game is to survive as long as you can while blocks fall from the sky. If you get hit you lose.

You can play the game via running the files in your text editor / IDE while having the folders in the proper place.
(I had issues with pyinstaller so I cant provide a proper exe file to play it at the moment)

After you run the game via text editor/IDE or via the exe. file the controls for the game are as following:

Left arrow / Left arrow + shift - > Walk left / Run left
Right arrow / Right arrow + shift - > Walk right / Run right
Space - Jump
R - Restart (You may at the start, middle or end of the game and it will reset it)
Q - closes the program.

The objective of the game:
Last as long as you can and get as high of a score as possible. The longer the game goes the faster the blocks drop, with a maximum of 3 blocks falling.
There is a speed up object you can collide with on the screen in order to increase your speed steadily to help you survive longer, though at the same time it can cause you to bump into the blocks uninentionally so keep that in mind.

Built with:
PyGame
Created by:
Me

Note:
There are a few bugs I had a bit trouble figuring out how to fix but they are minor.
- The blocks / speed up images sometimes can be seen partially or mostly of screen but are still interactable.
- when you get hit by a block it can become a bit buggy but if you click the "R" button it should reset everything.
